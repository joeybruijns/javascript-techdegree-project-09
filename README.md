# REST API Project
## Project 09 | Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree

In this project, weâ€™ll create a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```

And lastly, start the application.

To test the Express server, browse to the URL *http://localhost:5000.*
